# Backup utils

I wanted something personnal to manage my backups and did not find anything that suited me well, so I decided to create this tool. Here are the features I want initially:

- [ ] Be able to know if a directory has changed, save previous state in metadata file
- [ ] Set up a master drive and slave drives for each folder I want to backup, and keep that stored in the backup general metadata.
- [ ] Store latest backup sync date in backup metadata.
- [ ] Manage what do I do if I split a folder into two
- [ ] Be able to delete drives?
- [ ] Keep information about the whole folder structure in the metadata for all drives.
- [ ] Keep information about folder sizes in the folder structure in the metadata for all drives.
- [ ] Depending on the importance you give to the data, automatically determine how to backup the data and the user just connects the drives and the tool does the rest.

## Comparison tool
- [ ] 1st just compare if the files are the same
- [ ] Be able to see if I moved or renamed files
- [ ] Generalize this to the greatest group in some kind of visulization
- [ ] Compare the files only locally in their respective folders for fast comparison?
